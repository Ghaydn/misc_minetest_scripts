# Miscellaneous minetest scripts
for luacontrollers and lua tubes. Maybe someone would need these.

**drawer_helper**: helps to send items to the drawer controller from some buffering chest.
**blinker** (old version), **blinker_mega**: blinks the smart way. See description in comment section.
**sorter_mega**: sorts items, can use re-implemented "string.find", "array_find", "is_mod" and
"string_begins" functions.
